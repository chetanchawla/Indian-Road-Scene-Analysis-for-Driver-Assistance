Indian-Road-Scene-Analysis-for-Driver-Assistance
Driver assistance systems have progressed rapidly in recent years to increase road safety by assisting drivers with lane 
departure alerts or automatic braking during potential collisions. Developing such an assistance system for Indian roads
presents a massive task owing to the prevailing chaotic trafÔ¨Åc conditions, especially in India. Therefore, the key goal of 
our work is to develop a driver assistance system for which we apply road scene analysis techniques and vehicle-to-cloud 
communication to avoid vehicle-to-pedestrian collision and vehicle-to-vehicle collision, respectively. Our work is divided 
into two phases - 
(i) Prototyping a driver assistance system to prevent vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-pedestrian collision,
and
(ii)Introducing a pedestrian detection benchmark dataset consisting of videos collected on roads in New Delhi ,India.

While prototype-building serves as a task to understand the deceptive issues involved in building a driver assistance system,
the second part aims at getting the ground ready for solving problems associated with pedestrian detection in heterogeneous
scenarios.
